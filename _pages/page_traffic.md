As scientists and engineers continue to study and work on the advancement of autonomous vehicles, one of the challenges is to identify road signs like speed limit signs, stop signs, yield signs, etc. Traffic sign classification is the process of identifying different types of traffic signs. In this Deep Learning project, a computer model will be created to classify traffic signs using a special type of brain and program called a convolutional neural network (CNN) and Keras library.

# Dataset

The very basic idea of Machine learning is to provide a computer with data, rather than explicit algorithms. Using these data, the computer learns to recognize patterns and becomes able to execute tasks on its own. The image dataset is consists of more than 50,000 pictures of various traffic signs(speed limit, crossing, traffic signals, etc.) Around 43 different classes are present in the dataset for image classification. The dataset classes vary in size like some class has very few images while others have a vast number of images. The dataset doesnâ€™t take much time and space to download as the file size is around 314.36 MB. It contains two separate folders, train and test, where the train folder is consists of classes, and every category contains various images.
